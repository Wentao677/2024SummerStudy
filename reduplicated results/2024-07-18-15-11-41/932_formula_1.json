I then looked at the tables and columns that contain information about drivers, races, and seasons. I realized that the drivers table has a column for forename and surname, and the races table has a column for year. I also noticed that the races table has a foreign key referencing the seasons table, which has a column for year. I then constructed a query that joins the drivers, races, and seasons tables based on the foreign keys, and filters the results to only include rows where the forename is 'Lewis' and the surname is 'Hamilton'.",

        "status": "success"
