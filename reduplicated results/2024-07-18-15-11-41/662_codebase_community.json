The hint also mentions BountyAmount = 50, which is a column in the votes table. Therefore, we need to include the posts and votes tables in our query. Additionally, the votes table is linked to the posts table through the PostId foreign key, so we also need the posts table to establish this relationship. Finally, we need to filter the results to include only posts with votes that have a bounty of 50, which is only possible by joining the posts and votes tables.",
