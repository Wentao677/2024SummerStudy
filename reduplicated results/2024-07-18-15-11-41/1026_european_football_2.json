To answer this question, we need to identify the home teams that lost matches in the 2015/2016 season. We can do this by joining the Match table with the Team table to get the home team information, and then filtering the results to only include matches where the home team lost. We also need to filter the results to only include matches from the 2015/2016 season. Finally, we need to group the results by home team and count the number of lost matches for each team.
