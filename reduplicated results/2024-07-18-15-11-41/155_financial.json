The hint suggests that the percentage can be calculated by dividing the count of 'Gold' cards issued prior to 1998 by the total count of 'Gold' cards and then multiplying by 100. I then used the provided database schema to identify the relevant tables and columns. I used the 'card' table to filter for 'Gold' cards and the 'issued' column to filter for cards issued prior to 1998. I used the COUNT function to count the total number of 'Gold' cards and the SUM function with a CASE statement to count the number of 'Gold' cards issued prior to 1998. Finally, I divided the count of 'Gold' cards issued prior to 1998 by the total count of 'Gold' cards and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.",
