To answer this question, we need to identify the table that contains the expense information, including the description and cost. The hint also suggests that we need to link this information to the events. By analyzing the database schema, we find that the expense table contains the necessary information, and it is linked to the budget table through the link_to_budget foreign key, which is in turn linked to the event table through the link_to_event foreign key. Therefore, we need to use the expense table, the budget table, and the event table to answer the question.",
