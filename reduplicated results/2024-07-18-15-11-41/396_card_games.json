The hint clarifies that 'sensitive content warning' refers to hasContentWarning = 1, 'available on paper' refers to availability = 'paper', and '1993' refers to frameVersion. To answer this question, we need to identify the cards that meet these conditions. The hint also suggests that we should focus on the 'cards' table, which has columns for frameVersion and availability. Additionally, we need to consider the 'foreign_data' table to link the cards to their respective UUIDs, and the 'legalities' table to filter out cards with sensitive content warnings. Finally, we need to consider the 'sets' table to filter out cards that are not available on paper. Therefore, the necessary tables are 'cards', 'foreign_data', 'legalities', and 'sets'.",
