Therefore, we need to use the superhero table to retrieve the weights of Emil Blonsky and Charles Chandler. Additionally, the hint mentions the use of the SUM function, which is typically used with aggregate functions like GROUP BY. However, the question does not specify any grouping criteria. Therefore, we need to use the hero_attribute table to join with the superhero table and filter the results based on the full_name column.
