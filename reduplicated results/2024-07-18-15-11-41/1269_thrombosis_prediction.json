To answer this question, we need to identify the patients who meet these conditions. The 'Examination' table provides the 'Examination Date' information, and the 'Laboratory' table contains the SC170 values. The 'Patient' table is necessary to link the examination dates and laboratory test results to the corresponding patient IDs.
