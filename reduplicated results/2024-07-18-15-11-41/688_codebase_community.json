To answer this question, we need to identify the posts that meet these conditions. The ViewCount is stored in the posts table, and the CommentCount is stored in the posts table as well. The hint also mentions that we need to consider the relationship between posts and comments. Therefore, we need to join the posts table with the comments table to filter out the posts that have received comments. Finally, we need to filter the results to only include posts with a ViewCount greater than 35000 and a CommentCount of 0.",
