        "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "I started by analyzing the question and identifying the key phrases 'lap record' and 'how long did he spend at the pit stop'. I realized that 'lap record' refers to the fastest time recorded, which is related to the time spent at the pit stop. I then looked at the database schema and identified the relevant tables and columns: races, pitStops, and lapTimes. I joined the races table with the pitStops table on the raceId column to get the pit stop information for the Austrian Grand Prix race. I then filtered the results to get the pit stop with the fastest time (i.e., the lowest milliseconds value). Finally, I selected the time and duration columns from the resulting row.",
