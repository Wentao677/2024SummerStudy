I noticed that the 'races' table has a 'date' column and a 'time' column, which could potentially hold the information I'm looking for. I also noticed that the 'circuits' table has a 'location' column that matches the 'Abu Dhabi' value mentioned in the question. I then joined the 'circuits' and 'races' tables on the 'circuitId' column to link the Abu Dhabi Circuit to the corresponding race. Finally, I filtered the results to only include races that took place between 2010 and 2019.",
