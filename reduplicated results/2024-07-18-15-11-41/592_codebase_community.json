Therefore, we need to join the badges table with the users table to get the count of badges for each user. The badges table alone is not sufficient because it only provides the count of badges, but not the user information. The users table alone is not sufficient because it does not provide the count of badges. We also need to filter the results to include only users with more than 5 badges.
