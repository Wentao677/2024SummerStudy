The hint provides the exact conditions for these two criteria. To answer this question, we need to identify patients who meet both conditions. We can start by finding patients with T-BIL >= 2.0, which is possible by querying the Laboratory table. Then, we need to check if these patients have a peripheral pattern observed in the sheet of ANA examination, which is stored in the Examination table. Finally, we need to link these patients to the Patient table to retrieve their diagnosis. Therefore, we need to use the Laboratory, Examination, and Patient tables to answer the question.",
