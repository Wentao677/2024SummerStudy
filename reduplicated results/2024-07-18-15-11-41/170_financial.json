The hint provides the specific operation type 'VYBER KARTOU' which means credit card withdrawals. To answer this question, we need to identify the transactions that are credit card withdrawals and occurred after 1995. The operation type 'VYBER KARTOU' is present in the 'trans' table, which contains information about transactions. The 'trans' table also has a column 'date' which stores the date of the transaction. We can filter the transactions by the operation type and date to get the desired result. The 'account' table is also necessary as it provides the link between the transactions and the accounts. The 'account' table has a foreign key to the 'district' table, which is not necessary for this question, but it's still required to get the correct result.",
