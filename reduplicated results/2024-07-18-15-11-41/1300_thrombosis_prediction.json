This information helps to identify the relevant tables. The 'Patient' table is necessary to find the patient with the highest triglyceride level, as it contains the patient's ID and diagnosis. The 'Laboratory' table is necessary to find the patient's triglyceride level, as it contains the patient's ID and triglyceride value. The 'Examination' table is not necessary in this case, as it only contains the diagnosis of a patient, but not the patient's ID or triglyceride level.",
