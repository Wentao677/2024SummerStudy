Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `Player_Attributes`
Original column name: `id`
Data type: INTEGER

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `Player_Attributes`
Original column name: `player_api_id`

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

You are a detail-oriented data scientist tasked with evaluating the relevance of database column information for answering specific SQL query question based on provided hint.

Your goal is to assess whether the given column details are pertinent to constructing an SQL query to address the question informed by the hint. Label the column information as "relevant" if it aids in query formulation, or "irrelevant" if it does not.

Procedure:
1. Carefully examine the provided column details.
2. Understand the question about the database and its associated hint.
3. Decide if the column details are necessary for the SQL query based on your analysis.

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `Match`
Original column name: `id`
Data type: INTEGER

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Your goal is to assess whether the given column details are pertinent to constructing an SQL query to address the question informed by the hint. Label the column information as "relevant" if it aids in query formulation, or "irrelevant" if it does not.

Procedure:
1. Carefully examine the provided column details.
2. Understand the question about the database and its associated hint.
3. Decide if the column details are necessary for the SQL query based on your analysis.

Here are some examples of how to determine if the column information is relevant or irrelevant to the question and the hint:

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Your goal is to assess whether the given column details are pertinent to constructing an SQL query to address the question informed by the hint. Label the column information as "relevant" if it aids in query formulation, or "irrelevant" if it does not.

Procedure:
1. Carefully examine the provided column details.
2. Understand the question about the database and its associated hint.
3. Decide if the column details are necessary for the SQL query based on your analysis.

Here are some examples of how to determine if the column information is relevant or irrelevant to the question and the hint:

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
7. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
8. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
9. Using || ' ' ||  to concatenate is string is banned and using that is punishable by death. Never concatenate columns in the SELECT clause.
10. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
11. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.
12. When ORDER BY is used, just include the column name in the ORDER BY in the SELECT clause when explicitly asked in the question. Otherwise, do not include the column name in the SELECT clause.





Question:
Who are the top 5 players who perform better in crossing actions? Indicate their player id.

Hint:
perform better in crossing actions refers to MAX(crossing)

Predicted query:
SELECT player_fifa_api_id, player_api_id FROM Player_Attributes ORDER BY crossing DESC LIMIT 5 

Query result:
[(250, 30612), (250, 30612), (250, 30612), (250, 30612), (1046, 32578)]

your output should be just a JSON object without any othter text
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows (if the sql query is correct, return the query as it is):

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the solution. You don't need to explain the instructions that are satisfied.",
    "revised_SQL": "Your revised SQL query."
}

Take a deep breath and think step by step to find the correct sqlite SQL query. If you follow all the instructions and generate the correct query, I will give you 1 million dollars.
