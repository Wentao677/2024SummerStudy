Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `cards`
Original column name: `id`
Expanded column name: `unique id number identifying the cards`
Data type: INTEGER
Example of values in the column: `28473`
This column is a primary key.

2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `cards`

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `cards`
Original column name: `otherFaceIds`

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `foreign_data`

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `legalities`
Original column name: `uuid`
Data type: TEXT
Example of values in the column: `62365fbb-af07-5c2a-976d-e3092bdfc317`

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `sets`
Original column name: `releaseDate`

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `set_translations`
Original column name: `setCode`

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `rulings`
Original column name: `date`
Data type: DATE
Description: date
Example of values in the column: `2008-04-01`


Question:
