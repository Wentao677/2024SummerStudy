Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

You are a detail-oriented data scientist tasked with evaluating the relevance of database column information for answering specific SQL query question based on provided hint.

Your goal is to assess whether the given column details are pertinent to constructing an SQL query to address the question informed by the hint. Label the column information as "relevant" if it aids in query formulation, or "irrelevant" if it does not.

Procedure:
1. Carefully examine the provided column details.
2. Understand the question about the database and its associated hint.

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

You are a detail-oriented data scientist tasked with evaluating the relevance of database column information for answering specific SQL query question based on provided hint.

Your goal is to assess whether the given column details are pertinent to constructing an SQL query to address the question informed by the hint. Label the column information as "relevant" if it aids in query formulation, or "irrelevant" if it does not.

Procedure:
1. Carefully examine the provided column details.
2. Understand the question about the database and its associated hint.
3. Decide if the column details are necessary for the SQL query based on your analysis.

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

You are a detail-oriented data scientist tasked with evaluating the relevance of database column information for answering specific SQL query question based on provided hint.

Your goal is to assess whether the given column details are pertinent to constructing an SQL query to address the question informed by the hint. Label the column information as "relevant" if it aids in query formulation, or "irrelevant" if it does not.

Procedure:
1. Carefully examine the provided column details.
2. Understand the question about the database and its associated hint.
3. Decide if the column details are necessary for the SQL query based on your analysis.

Here are some examples of how to determine if the column information is relevant or irrelevant to the question and the hint:

Example 1:
Column information:
Original column name: `movie_title`
Data type: TEXT
Description: Name of the movie
Example of values in the column: `La Antena`


Question:
Name movie titles released in year 1945. Sort the listing by the descending order of movie popularity.

HINT:
released in the year 1945 refers to movie_release_year = 1945;

```json
{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question specifically asks for movie titles from a particular year and to sort them by popularity. The column movie_title directly provides the names of movies, which is exactly what is required to list the movie titles as requested in the question.",
  "is_column_information_relevant": "Yes"
}
```

Example 2:
Column information:
Original column name: `movie_release_year`
Expanded column name: ``
Data type: INTEGER
Description: Release year of the movie
Example of values in the column: `2007`


Question:

HINT:
movie title rated in April 2020 refers to rating_timestamp_utc LIKE '%2020-04-%'; user is a trial list refers to user_trialist = 1;

```json
{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question and hint focus on movies rated in a specific month and year and by a specific type of user (trialist), neither of which relates to the movie_release_year column. This column only provides the year movies were released, which is not what is being queried.",
  "is_column_information_relevant": "No"
}
```

Example 3:
Column information:
Original column name: `user_has_payment_method`
Data type: INTEGER
Description: whether the user was a paying subscriber when he rated the movie
Value description: 1 = the user was a paying subscriber when he rated the movie  0 = the user was not a paying subscriber when he rated
Example of values in the column: `0`


Question:
How many users, who were a paying subscriber when they rated the movie, gave the movie that was released in 1924 and directed by Erich von Stroheim a rating score of 5?

HINT:
Directed by Buster Keaton refers to director_name; released in 1924 refers to movie_release_year = 1924; paying subscriber refers to user_has_payment_method = 1; rating score of 5 refers to rating_score = 5;

```json
{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks about users who were paying subscribers and rated a specific movie from 1924 directed by a specific director. The user_has_payment_method column indicates whether a user was a paying subscriber at the time of rating, which is directly relevant to the question and the hint focusing on subscribers.",
  "is_column_information_relevant": "Yes"

```json
{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question requires filtering movies directed by `Stanley Kubrick` to calculate the average popularity. The director_name column provides the director's name, and as shown in the example values, it includes `Stanley Kubrick`, which is essential for filtering movies directed by this specific director.",
  "is_column_information_relevant": "Yes"
}
```

Example 6:
Column information:
Original column name: `list_creation_date_utc`
Data type: TEXT
Description: Creation date for the list

```json
{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for list titles created by users eligible for a trial. The list_creation_date_utc column, which provides the creation dates of lists, is irrelevant because the hint and the question are concerned with the trial status of the users, not the dates the lists were created.",
  "is_column_information_relevant": "No"
}
```

Example 7:
Column information:
Original column name: `Installs`
Data type: TEXT
Description: Number of user downloads/installs for the app (as when scraped)

  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question involves finding users who created a list in a specific month and year, with additional focus on those who had the most followers. The list_followers column directly applies because it provides the exact data needed to identify which user's list had the most followers during the specified time.",
  "is_column_information_relevant": "Yes"
}
```

Example 13:
Column information:
Original column name: `rating_score`
Data type: INTEGER
Description: Rating score ranging from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest)

HINT:
comments refer to critic_comments

```json
{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the release year of the first movie by the director who has directed the most films. The movie_release_year column directly provides this necessary information, as it lists the release years of movies. This column is essential to determine when that first movie was released, making it relevant to the question despite the hint focusing solely on comments related to critic ratings.",
  "is_column_information_relevant": "Yes"
}
```

Example 15:
Original column name: `Price`
Data type: TEXT
Description: Price of the app (as when scraped)

  "is_column_information_relevant": "Yes"
}
```

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `results`
Original column name: `statusId`
Expanded column name: `status Id`
Data type: INTEGER
Description: status ID
Value description: its category description appear in the table status
Example of values in the column: `5`
This column references the following columns:
    Table: `status`, Column: `statusId`

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
7. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
8. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
9. Using || ' ' ||  to concatenate is string is banned and using that is punishable by death. Never concatenate columns in the SELECT clause.
10. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
11. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.
12. When ORDER BY is used, just include the column name in the ORDER BY in the SELECT clause when explicitly asked in the question. Otherwise, do not include the column name in the SELECT clause.





Question:
List circuits in USA which hosted f1 races in 2006. State the name and location of circuit and the name of the race it hosted.

Hint:


Predicted query:
SELECT DISTINCT T1.circuitRef, T1.location FROM circuits AS T1 INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.circuitId = T2.circuitId WHERE T2.year = 2006 AND T1.location LIKE '%USA%' 

Query result:
[]

your output should be just a JSON object without any othter text
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows (if the sql query is correct, return the query as it is):

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the solution. You don't need to explain the instructions that are satisfied.",
    "revised_SQL": "Your revised SQL query."
}

Take a deep breath and think step by step to find the correct sqlite SQL query. If you follow all the instructions and generate the correct query, I will give you 1 million dollars.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "I started by identifying the tables and columns related to the question. I noticed that the 'circuits' table has a 'location' column and a 'circuitId' column that is referenced in the 'races' table. I also noticed that the 'races' table has a 'year' column and a 'circuitId' column that references the 'circuitId' column in the 'circuits' table. I then joined the two tables on the 'circuitId' column and filtered the results to only include rows where the 'year' is 2006 and the 'location' contains the string 'USA'.",
