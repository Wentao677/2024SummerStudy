Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `cards`
Original column name: `cardKingdomId`

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `cards`

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Now, its your turn to determine whether the provided column information can help formulate a SQL query to answer the given question, based on the provided hint.

The following guidelines are VERY IMPORTANT to follow. Make sure to check each of them carefully before making your decision:
1. You're given only one column's information, which alone isn't enough to answer the full query. Concentrate solely on this provided data and assess its relevance to the question and hint without considering any missing information.
2. Read the column information carefully and understand the description of it, then see if the question or the hint is asking or referring to the same information. If yes then the column information is relevant, otherwise it is irrelevant.
3. Look beyond mere keywords. Assess whether there is a meaningful, semantic connection between the column information and the needs of the question or hint. Mere word matches do not necessarily imply relevance.
4. If the question refers to applying a logic on a data such as average, sum, max, min, or any other operation, and the column information is a part of that logic, then the column information is relevant.
5. Pay attention to the provided `Example of values in the column`. If you see a shared keyword between the example and the question or hint, then the column information is relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)
6. If you see the column name appeared in the hint, then it is definitely relevant. (VERY IMPORTANT)

Column information:
Table name: `rulings`
Original column name: `uuid`
Data type: TEXT
Example of values in the column: `7fef665c-36a1-5f7a-9299-cf8938708710`
This column references the following columns:
    Table: `cards`, Column: `uuid`


Question:
Among the cards whose version of frame style is 1997, what is the status of the card illustrated by D. Alexander Gregory in legacy play format that has sensitive content or Wizards of the Coast?

HINT:
version of frame style is 1997 refers to frameVersion = '1997'; illustrated by D. Alexander Gregory refers to artist = 'D. Alexander Gregory'; sensitive content refers to hasContentWarning = 1; legacy play format refers to format = 'legacy'; status of the card refers to status


Take a deep breath and provide your answer in the following json format:

```json
{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "One line explanation of why or why not the column information is relevant to the question and the hint.",
  "is_column_information_relevant": "Yes" or "No"
}
```

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
7. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
8. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
9. Using || ' ' ||  to concatenate is string is banned and using that is punishable by death. Never concatenate columns in the SELECT clause.
10. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
11. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.
12. When ORDER BY is used, just include the column name in the ORDER BY in the SELECT clause when explicitly asked in the question. Otherwise, do not include the column name in the SELECT clause.





Question:
Among the cards whose version of frame style is 1997, what is the status of the card illustrated by D. Alexander Gregory in legacy play format that has sensitive content or Wizards of the Coast?

Hint:
version of frame style is 1997 refers to frameVersion = '1997'; illustrated by D. Alexander Gregory refers to artist = 'D. Alexander Gregory'; sensitive content refers to hasContentWarning = 1; legacy play format refers to format = 'legacy'; status of the card refers to status

Predicted query:
SELECT T2.status FROM cards AS T1 INNER JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.frameVersion = '1997' AND T1.artist = 'D. Alexander Gregory' AND T2.format = 'legacy' 

Query result:
[('Legal',), ('Banned',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Banned',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',), ('Legal',)]

your output should be just a JSON object without any othter text
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows (if the sql query is correct, return the query as it is):

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the solution. You don't need to explain the instructions that are satisfied.",
    "revised_SQL": "Your revised SQL query."
}

Take a deep breath and think step by step to find the correct sqlite SQL query. If you follow all the instructions and generate the correct query, I will give you 1 million dollars.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "I started by identifying the conditions mentioned in the question: frame style is 1997, illustrated by D. Alexander Gregory, has sensitive content or Wizards of the Coast, and legacy play format. I then used these conditions to construct the SQL query, joining the cards and legalities tables to retrieve the status of the card. I also filtered the results to only include cards that meet the specified conditions.",
