The hint suggests that 'thrombocytopenia' refers to symptoms and 'SLE' refers to diagnosis. This implies that we need to identify patients with thrombocytopenia symptoms and then check if they have SLE diagnosis. The hint also provides a calculation formula, which involves summing up the diagnosis values that contain 'ITP' and 'SLE'. This calculation requires access to the diagnosis values, which are stored in the Examination and Patient tables. Additionally, we need to link patients to their examination records, which is facilitated by the foreign key in the Examination table. Therefore, we need to include Examination, Patient, and possibly Laboratory tables in the SQL query.",
