To answer this question, we need to identify the patients who are male (SEX = 'M') and were tested in the lab during the specified date range. We also need to group these patients by month and calculate the average number. The Examination table is not relevant to this question, as it only provides information about the examination date, which is not necessary for this calculation. The Patient table is necessary to identify the male patients, but it does not provide information about the laboratory tests. The Laboratory table is necessary to identify the dates of the laboratory tests, and it provides the necessary information to group the patients by month.
