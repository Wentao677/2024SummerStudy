I joined these tables based on the raceId and driverId columns. I then filtered the results to only include the 2008 Australian Grand Prix and the driver with the surname 'Hamilton' and forename 'Lewis'. Finally, I sorted the results by the milliseconds column in ascending order and limited the results to the top 1 row to get the fastest lap.",
