Some common alignments for superheroes include: Good: These superheroes are typically kind, selfless, and dedicated to protecting others and upholding justice. Examples of good alignments include Superman, Wonder Woman, and Spider-Man. Neutral: These superheroes may not always prioritize the greater good, but they are not necessarily evil either. They may act in their own self-interest or make decisions based on their own moral code. Examples of neutral alignments include the Hulk and Deadpool. \u0095\tBad: These superheroes are typically selfish, manipulative, and willing to harm others in pursuit of their own goals. Examples of evil alignments include Lex Luthor and the Joker."
