The hint clarifies that abnormal APTT refers to APTT > 45, and 'does not have thrombosis' refers to Thrombosis = 0. To answer this question, we need to identify patients with abnormal APTT and check if they have thrombosis. We can do this by joining the Laboratory table with the Examination table, as Laboratory contains APTT values and Examination contains thrombosis values. We also need the Patient table to link the Laboratory and Examination tables to patients. Therefore, we need to select the Laboratory, Examination, and Patient tables.",
