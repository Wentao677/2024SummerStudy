They may act in their own self-interest or make decisions based on their own moral code. Examples of neutral alignments include the Hulk and Deadpool. \u0095\tBad: These superheroes are typically selfish, manipulative, and willing to harm others in pursuit of their own goals. Examples of evil alignments include Lex Luthor and the Joker."
