The hint clarifies that Admission = '+' refers to patients who were admitted to the hospital. The normal level of white blood cells is defined as WBC between 3.5 and 9.0. To answer this question, we need to identify patients who were admitted to the hospital and have WBC values within the normal range. This requires information from the Examination, Patient, and Laboratory tables. The Examination table provides the relationship between patients and laboratory tests, the Patient table provides the admission status, and the Laboratory table provides the WBC values. Therefore, we need to use all three tables to answer the question.",
