The hint clarifies that 'among the members' refers to members with a position of 'Member' and 'extra large t-shirt size' refers to 'X-Large'. This information helps to narrow down the scope of the query to the 'member' table. The 'member' table is necessary because it contains the information about the members' positions and t-shirt sizes. Additionally, the 'member' table has a foreign key to the 'major' table, which is not necessary for this question. However, the 'member' table also has a foreign key to the 'zip_code' table, which is necessary because it provides additional information about the members' locations. Therefore, the 'zip_code' table is also necessary. Finally, the 'major' table is not necessary for this question, but it is included in the 'member' table's foreign key, which is why it is not excluded.",
