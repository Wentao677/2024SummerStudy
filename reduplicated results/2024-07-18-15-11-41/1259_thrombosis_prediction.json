To answer this question, we need to identify patients who meet these conditions and then retrieve their corresponding diseases. The tables Examination and Patient are necessary to find patients born after 1985-1-1, as they contain the Birthday and Diagnosis information. The Laboratory table is required to check the Rhuematoid Factor value, which is stored in the RA column. Therefore, we need to use all three tables to formulate the SQL query.",
