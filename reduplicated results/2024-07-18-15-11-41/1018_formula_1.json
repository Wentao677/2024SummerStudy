To identify the pit stops of Lewis Hamilton, we need to join the 'pitStops' table with the 'drivers' table, as the 'driverId' in 'pitStops' references the 'driverId' in 'drivers'. We also need to filter the results to only include races where Lewis Hamilton participated, which can be done by joining the 'pitStops' table with the 'races' table and then filtering for races where the 'driverId' matches Lewis Hamilton's.
