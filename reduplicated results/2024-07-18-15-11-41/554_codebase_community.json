The 'badges' table has a foreign key 'UserId' which references the 'users' table, indicating that each badge is associated with a user. We also need to join this table with the 'users' table to get the display name of the user. The 'users' table has a primary key 'Id' which matches with the 'UserId' in the 'badges' table. Additionally, we need to group the results by 'UserId' and count the number of badges for each user. This can be achieved by using the 'COUNT' function and 'GROUP BY' clause.
