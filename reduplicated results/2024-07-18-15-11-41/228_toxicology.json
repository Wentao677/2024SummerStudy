The hint also implies that we need to consider the 'atom' table, which contains information about individual atoms, including their elements. Additionally, we need the 'molecule' table to filter the atoms by the specific molecule TR206. The 'connected' table is not necessary for this question, as it only provides information about bonds between atoms, which is not relevant to the question. Finally, the 'bond' table is not necessary as it does not provide any information about the elements of atoms.",
