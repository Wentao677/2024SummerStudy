The hint clarifies that underage patients are those with a birthday before 18 years old, and the examination date falls within the specified three-year period. To answer this question, we need to identify the patients who were examined during this period and are underage. This requires information from the Patient table to determine the age of each patient, and the Examination table to determine the examination dates. The Laboratory table is not necessary for this question, as it only provides additional information about laboratory tests, which is not relevant to the question.",
