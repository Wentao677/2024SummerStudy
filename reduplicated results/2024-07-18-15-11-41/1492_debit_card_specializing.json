The hint provides a formula to calculate this percentage, which involves the total number of KAM customers and the total number of KAM customers who pay in euros. To find these numbers, we need to analyze the transactions of KAM customers. The transactions are stored in the transactions_1k table, which contains information about the customer, gas station, and product involved in each transaction. The currency used in each transaction is not explicitly stored, but we can infer it from the customers table, which has a column for the customer's currency. Therefore, we need to join the transactions_1k table with the customers table to get the currency information. We also need to filter the transactions to only include those made by KAM customers. This can be done by joining the transactions_1k table with the yearmonth table, which contains information about the customer's segment. Finally, we need to count the total number of KAM customers and the total number of KAM customers who pay in euros, and then calculate the percentage.",
