This information helps identify the necessary tables. The borderColor column is present in the cards table, which means we need to include this table to filter cards by their border color. The cardKingdomFoilId and cardKingdomId columns are also present in the cards table, which means we need to include this table to filter cards by their power level. The hint also mentions that cardKingdomFoilId is not null AND cardKingdomId is not null, which implies that we need to consider the relationships between cards and foreign_data or legalities tables. However, since the question only asks for the number of white bordered cards that are powerful, we don't need to consider these relationships. Therefore, the necessary tables are cards and possibly foreign_data or legalities, but we can ignore these tables for now.",
