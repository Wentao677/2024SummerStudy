The hint points towards the specific elements of the database schema that are crucial for answering the question effectively.

Additionally, the 'frpm' table is not necessary for this question as it only contains information about the school's code and other details, but not the mailing city or charter number. The 'satscores' table is also not necessary as it does not contain information about the school's location or charter number.
